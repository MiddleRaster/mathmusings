## Welcome to MiddleRaster's Math Musings!

I love math, but I don't have too, too much to say about it.

That being said, [here](TheIntegralOfOneOverX)'s a post on how we know that
\\[
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| 
\\].

Try this link:
[
\\[
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| 
\\]

### Sandbox stuff below:

Inline: \\(E=mc^2\\)

Block with $$:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2x
$$
