## Welcome to MiddleRaster's Math Musings!

I love math, but I don't have too, too much to say about it.

That being said, [here](TheIntegralOfOneOverX)'s a post on how we know that \\[\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| \\].




### Sandbox stuff below:

Inline: \\(E=mc^2\\)

Block with $$:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2x
$$

Block with \[...\]:

\\[
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\\]
