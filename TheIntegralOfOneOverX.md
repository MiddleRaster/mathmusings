title: The Inegral of One Over X
---

If you've ever taken a first year calculus class, after learning how to integrate polynomials, the next thing you learn is how to integrate \\(1/x.\\)

Now, usually, the teacher just tells you that the answer is \\(\ln(x)\\) without proof. And further, most proofs online use the fact that the inverse function of \\(\ln(x)\\) is \\(e^x\\), again without proof.

This will not do.

Let's prove 
\\[
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| 
\\] from scratch, the way it was done historically.
